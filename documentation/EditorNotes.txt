This file explains various nuances of the editing process.




===TRANSITION EDITOR====

Transition block represents

    ACTOR  +  TARGET
           =
NEW ACTOR  +  NEW TARGET



==Moving Objects==

To specify what is left behind by a moving object, set ACTOR and NEW TARGET
to moving object (or before/after objects of move transition) and set
NEW ACTOR to what is left behind by moving object.

If moving object can consume an object that it moves onto, set TARGET as well.

Thus, a moving object can have distinct effects based on whether it is moving
into an empty space (bare ground) or moving onto an object that it can consume.



==Murder==
Handheld objects with Deadly Distance > 0 can be used to murder.

Put any person in the TARGET of the transition to indicate a generic on-person
transition.

The weapon is the ACTOR and NEW ACTOR is what ends up in the murderer's hand
afterward, whether or not the murder missed (example:  empty bow).

NEW TARGET is what ends up on the ground or in the grave afterward (example: 
arrow).


Last Use on the TARGET side indicates that NEW TARGET is a special grave
(example: bloody grave) and NEW ACTOR is what's left in the hand after a 
successful murder (example:  bloody bow).

So these two transitions together indicate what happens if the murder attempt
hits or misses.

Last Use on the ACTOR side indicates that NEW TARGET is what the victim
ends up holding if the murder connects (example:  wound blood).



==Editor Pickers==

Normally, the search box in a picker matches strings in an item's description.
Multiple terms can be separated by spaces, in which case only items matching
all the terms are shown.

Typing "." in the search box (a single period) shows a stack of recently-picked
items.

Searches for which you actually pick something, by clicking on it, are
added to the search history, accessible with the UP and DOWN arrow keys.

When clicking the Next and Prev buttons to page through results, holding CTRL
pages by 25 at a time.  Holding SHIFT pages by 125 at a time, and holding both
CTRL and SHIFT together pages by 625 at a time.

You can also find an item by its numerical ID by typing the ID in the search
box.

For the Object pickers, many of the fields and checkboxes can be used as a
search term to match Objects with those particular values.

Only one field or checkbox can be named (no space are allowed), and you can
search for Objects with fields that are less than, greater than, or equal
to the value you supply.

For example, searching for:

 food>10

will find all Objects with a food value greater than 10.  Searching for:

 food=8

will find all Objects with a food value equal to 8.  Searching for:

 MapP>0

will find all naturally-occurring objects

For checkboxes, 1 means checked, and 0 means not checked.  So for example:

 person=1

will find all person objects.



Sprite pickers are also field=value searchable, but Sprites have a more
limited number of fields:

solid
w
h
visibleW
visibleH

To find all non-solid (transparent) sprites, search for:

solid=0


To find all very sprites, search for:

visibleW>400
