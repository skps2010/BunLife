Various special-purpose text tags occur in object descriptions, as part
of the # comment in the object's description (everything after the # is not
displayed when mousing over the object in the game).





+alcoholD

Consuming adds D alcohol to consumer's drunkenness.  Example:  +alcohol1



+autoDefaultTrans

Default transition is triggered when player path will cross that object.  For
spring-loaded doors that auto-open.



+badgePosX,Y

Position of colored badge for an object owned/controlled by a leader and
followers.  Example: +badgePos-101,-20



+becomeUseD

For non-use objects that should turn into a specific use count in the newTarget
after a transition.  This allows (for example), the same scrap box to result
from scrapping different objects with differing amounts of resulting scrap
metal.  A nozzle is +becomeUse2, while a full piston head is +becomeUse6


+biomeBlockD

Prevents object from being constructed in biome D.  Example: +biomeBlock4



+biomeReqD

Object can only be constructed in biome D.  Example: +biomeReq1



+biomeSetD

Forces biome D under object.  Used to force a neutral biome under expert
waystones to make them touchable by everyone.  Example: +biomeSet3



+blocksMoving

Prevent moving objects from moving through non-blocking objects.  For example,
auto-open doors let players pass through, but they still block animals.



+blocksNonFollower

Prevents non-followers from passing through an otherwise non-blocking object.
For example, an auto-opening gate that only allows followers to pass.


+causeAutoOrient

Triggers auto-orientation of nearby auto-orienting objects (where this object
doesn't have multiple orientations defined).  For example, wall shelves that can
only be horizontal walls, but affect other nearby auto-orienting walls.



+causeAutoOrientH

Triggers auto-orientation only on the east and west neighbor.



+causeAutoOrientV

Triggers auto-orientation only on the north and south neighbor.



+containOffsetBottomX_4
+containOffsetBottomY_-15

Sets X and Y offset for objects that are contained in a container that has no
sprite in front of the contained objects (so their contained position is
defined by their lowest sprite, like they're sitting on top of the container).
For example, position of the object on a table.



+containOffsetX_70
+containOffsetY_-14

Sets X and Y offset for objects that are contained in a container that has one
or more sprites in front of the contained objects. For example, position of the
object in a basket.



+contV

For containers, define a class of containers with label V.
For containable objects, mark them so that they an only go in containers
with a matching label V.  This allows us to limit certain objects to certain
kinds of containers.  For example, you can only set a glass of wine down on
a food table.  You can't stuff it in a backpack.
Examples:  +contAnyTable   +contFoodDish   +contLabDish



+cornerV

Corner shape for auto-orienting object set with label V
Examples:  +cornerA   +cornerAdobe



+default

Example:  +emotEat_29_10



+expertFind

Touching this object gives the player an arrow to the expert for this object's

on a straight road and land at the closest object in the take-off direction
tagged with +land



+followerOwned

This object is co-owned by all of the owner's current followers.



+frontWall

This wall object is drawn in front of all other objects in its horizontal row.
Normally, wall-like objects are drawn in order left to right.  This tag is for
objects that stick out to the right in a way that looks bad with the default
overlap.



+giveClue

Holding this object gives a clue in the Headless Hunt contest.



+hellArrow

This object's monumentCall arrow points to HELL instead of BELL.



+hideBody

For an emote object that hides the entire body.



+hideHead

For an emote object that hides the head.



+hideRider

For a rideable object that hides the rider completely.



+horizontalV

Horizontal shape for auto-orienting object set with label V
Examples:  +horizontalA   +horizontalAdobe





+hungryWork10


+land

This object is a landing location for objects tagged with +fly.



+leaderInherit

This object is inherited by a deceased player's leadership heir instead of the
deceased player's children.



+map

This written object stores its creation location.  Whenever the written object
is read, they will also read the location and receive an arrow pointing to the

+nearPop_50_10000

This object can only be created if at least 50% of living players are within
10,000 tiles from the creation location.



+negativePhotoFixed

This object contains viewable negative photo information.



+negativePhotoUnfixed

This object contains negative photo information in unfixed form.



+neverDrop

Object is stuck in hand and never droppable, not even when entering a bad biome.



+noBackAccess

Objects that can't be manipulated by a player standing on the north side.
For example, a wall shelf can only be manipulated from the front side of the
wall.



+noCover

For floors that don't completely cover the underlying biome.  Thus, we
cannot skip drawing the underling biome in that spot.  For example, curved
roads.



+noHighlight

Don't highlight this object when player mouses over it.



+normalOnly

Tutorial players and Donkeytown players cannot construct this object.



+noWait

Certain objects are technically weapons, in that they are used on players and
may inflict a wound, but they don't have a waiting period before being executed.
For example, snowballs and tattoo needles.



+offScreenSound_V

When this object's creation sound happens off-screen, create an off-screen
sound icon at the edge of the screen with label V.
Example:  +offScreenSound_H   for the hunger sound with the "H" icon.



+owned

For objects that are owned upon creation, can only be manipulated by owners,
and can be shared with other owners.


+photo

This object creates a photo of the area in front of the object and posts it to
the photo server in both positive and negative form, attaching the resulting
photo ID to the object in its &written data.



+positivePhotoFixed

This object contains viewable positive photo information.



+positivePhotoUnfixed

This object contains positive photo information in unfixed form.



+primaryHomeland

This object, when created through a tapoutTrigger, is limited to a family's
primary homeland.



+roadD

D.  Example:  +road4426



+slotsInvis

Objects in this container are not visible.



+tapoutTrigger,XS,YS,XR,YR

When this object is created, it executes a tapout-trigger transition every
XS tiles in the X direction, every YS tiles in the Y direction, for a total
X,Y radius of XR,YR.  I.e., this object triggers a transition on a grid of objects near this object.  A tapout-trigger operation is defined as a transition
of this object as actor with the target grid object as the target. 
Examples:  +tapoutTrigger,1,1,1,1    +tapoutTrigger,40,40,160,0



+tempOwned

While +owned objects can only be manipulated by their owners, +tempOwned objects
still track ownership, but they can be pushed through transitions by non-owners.
For example, a shaky gate that hasn't become permanent yet can be destroyed
by a non-owner who doesn't approve of the gate's location.



+tool

This object is a tool that can be learned (no longer used, part of the old skill
system where you could chose a subset of tools to learn in a lifetime).



+toolV

This object is a tool that can be learned as part of a group of tools with 
label V (no longer used, part of the old skill system where you could chose a
subset of tools to learn in a lifetime).
Examples:  +toolBow_Drill   +toolChopping   +toolHoe



+useOnContained

This container allows transitions to occur on contained objects.  For example,
you can pour wine into an empty glass that is sitting on a table.



+varNumeral

This is a variable object (see $D below) that displays its variable number
visually by selectively displaying some of its Numeral#D sprites.  These digit
sprites are arranged in columns (1's column, 10's column, etc.)



+varSerialNumberD

This variable object counts up, server-wide, as instances of the object are
created, giving each one an incremented variable value.  D is the ID of this
sequence, so the server can track multiple separate sequences for different
classes of objects.  Example:  +varSerialNumber1



+verticalV

Vertical shape for auto-orienting object set with label V
Examples:  +verticalA   +verticalAdobe



+wall

Usually, objects are drawn in the wall layer based on their Hug Floor checkbox
(floorHugging property).  Non floor-hugging objects can be forced into the wall
drawing layer with the +wall tag.



+yumD

This object is in the same yum class as parent object with id D.  For example,
eating a single berry and a bowl of berries is in the same yum class.
Examples:  +yum1175   +yum1463






These are some weird ones that don't match the +tag format:



$D

This is a variable-numbered object with D possible versions.
Examples:  $10



fromDeath

These objects get their sprites pre-loaded to avoid partial-sprite
pop-in when someone dies.  Sprites for other object only get loaded if
they are present on our section of the map or they are one transition
away from what is present.  But death objects are special in that they aren't
the result of transitions, so they don't get pre-loaded through the normal
mechanism.



monumentStep

Part way to a monument.



monumentDone

The completion of a monument.



monumentCall

Object's creation sound is broadcast server-wide, and players get a BELL arrow
to the monument's location.



The Apocalypse

If an object's description directly matches these words (case sensitive)
then it triggers a server-wide apocalypse when it is created.
